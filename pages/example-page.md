# How RPA improves Productivity
Talk about operating costs and everyone agrees — lower is better. With Robotic Process Automation (RPA), an emerging technology, you can optimise your company’s work processes and in turn, reduce operating cost and raise productivity and customer service standards.

Through the automation of mundane and repetitive tasks, manpower can be deployed elsewhere to take on more value-added work and improve customer service. As such, there is a strong demand from both the industry and government agencies to incorporate RPA in their work processes.

> Starting from the year 2020, all [Engineering](https://www-rp-edu-sg-admin.cwp-stg.sg/seg/home) students at RP will be trained in RPA as part of their full-time Pre-employment Training curriculum. Plans are in the pipeline to provide professional RPA software certification for fulltime students and adult learners. Moving forward, RP will continue to partner with the industry to facilitate deeper research into automation and provide more training opportunities.
